HashMap - uses hashing , requires equals() and hashCode()

TreeSet - uses ordering, requires Comparable or Comparator

Do not alter key after insertions , it gets lost

Map does not implement Iterable

As iteration choices are different

So , we usually get a set of keys or collection of values or set of Entries to perform iterations as Set implements Iterable

Keys or Values ?

Set of keys as there are no duplicates  mao.keySet()

Collection of values as there can be duplicates and no order


Map.Entry static inner interface

Entries are also unique as keys are unique

Therefore , a Map also has method to return set of Entries , i.e map.entrySet()

Entry - defines equals() and hashCode() method


- getOrDefault()
- containsKey()
- containsValue()
