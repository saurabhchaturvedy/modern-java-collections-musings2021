Static methods in interfaces - just like static methods in classes -

They implement concept wide behaviours - not associated with any particular object


Default methods in interfaces - pretty similar to instance methods

-->  Real "implementation" methods

-->  Can be replaced by "overriding" method in any implementation

--> has access to "this" reference

--> knows about "this" as interface type only
