List allow duplicates
List has insertion order of elements

Set reject duplicates

Set insertion is by policy , no predictable order

Adding/removing element based on capacity of set may still change the order (Hashing)

Hashset contains() - hashing (equals() and hashCode())

TreeSet - binary tree - inorder

Tree cannot store equal elements
As root has lower and greater left and right elements

Treeset can directly use elements which have a natural ordering

Or Treeset can take a comparator as a parameter new TreeSet(new Comparator())

Different objects with same position cannot be stored in a tree set

Rules for a tree-set

same position inOrder must mean same object

Equals objects must have same positioning in order

TreeSet does not calls equals()

Elements must be mutually compatible types


While using TreeSet we must ensure that :

Ordering and Equality tests are consistent

Any changes in tree set objects should not change the ordering position

Comparator use - when we don't own the source code (3rd party library code)
