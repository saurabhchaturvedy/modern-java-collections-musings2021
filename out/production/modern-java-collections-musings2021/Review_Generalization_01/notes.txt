* Generalization helps commonalize objects in design rather than being specific

* Generalize without Inheritance - Interfaces

* Collections can simply be also understood as - BUCKET

* A List of Strings - good idea for a collections

* A List of everything - not good

* Objects , primitives - two types while trying to store as collections

* Interfaces in Java - Generalizations  (List)

* Implementation - How it does it ?  (ArrayList,LinkedList)

* Collection Interface

(i.) Some collections allow duplicate elements some don't .
(ii.) Some are ordered and some other are unordered .
(iii.) Some collections prohibit adding nulls .

JDK does not provide any direct implementation of collection interface .

* Collection should provide two standard contructors :

(i.) void constructor
(ii.) Single argument having that collection as an argument itself.

Collections provide methods
(i.) To mutate collections
(ii.) Immutable - Collection.unmodifiableCollection() throws UnsupportedOperationException
(iii.) Items in collections are not immutable .

List - Ordered (Insertion)

Set - UnOrdered , No duplicate entries



Collection  -------------------------> java.lang.iterable Interface (Provide a way to iterate over collections, Iterator)
Iterator has 2 main methods - hasNext() ? and next() .


Q: Why collections don't implement Iterator interface directly ?

A: Instead they implement Iterable Interface as everyone gets a separate iterator for them , and it doesn't result in any exceptions .

============
Map - not sub-interface of Collection - rather than grouping of individual items , its provides storing key value pairs in the collection .

get()
put()
containsKey()
containsValue()

keySet() -> Set (as they are unique)

values() -> Collection (as values can be duplicate)

Cannot have duplicate keys

Can have duplicate values

Map.Entry - inner interface of Map  (represents a single key and a value pair in the map)

getKey()

getValue()

setValue(val)
