Since Java 6 , its recommended use Deque interface instead of Stack .

Deque also has push() , pop() methods like stack .


Set sub-interfaces :

SortedSet  (JDK 1.2)

NavigableSet (JDK 1.6)  ----------- >  ConcurrentSkipListSet (for threaded situations)
                        ------------>  TreeSet

NavigableSet is kind of an upgrade over SortedSet interface , but since before Java 8 , as there was no concept of default
methods , an entirely new interface had to be created the newly supported behaviors .

SortedSet - 1,2,5,6,8,9,10

first() - 1

last() - 10

headSet(5) - 1,2 (excluding 5)

tailSet(8) - 8,9,10 (includes 8)

subSet(5,9) - 6,8,9 (excludes 5 , includes 9)
